## Project Description
At one point in our lives, we've all experienced having no data/internet connection before, which can be a hassle, no matter the situation. Especially when you're traveling. Progressive Budget is an application that allows users offline access when planning out their budget. The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When the user is entering transactions offline, the inputted data will populate the total when brought back online. This will allow the users a fast and easy way to track their money, which is important. What's more important, is allowing them access to that information anytime. 

Below is an example that shows the application's appearance and functionality:
